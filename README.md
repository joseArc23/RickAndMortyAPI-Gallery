# RickAndMortyAPI-Gallery
To build this project the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) was used.
- It started with a mobile-first view then scaled to desktop sizes.
- All made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Purpose
The target to this project was to consume an API using callbacks, promises and async-await.
Every page has its own `.js` file
- `index.html` (callbacks)
- `locations.html` (promises)
- `episodes.html` (async/await)
